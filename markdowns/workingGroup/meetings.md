         1. In the VC world, and ZCaps there is a roll for Issuer Software and Verifier Software
         1. Needs to have access to the ability to sign with crypto keys and it creates a ZCap, or VC, or Verifiable Presentation
            1. Delegated non-centralized approach 
            1. Often tied to a wallet, which is often off-line

            1. Keystore 
      1. Verifier Software
         1. Flip side of issuer software, if people developing for Cosmos blockchains to being able to verify a given ZCap or VC, they can call this component to do this verification
      1. Authorization Module
