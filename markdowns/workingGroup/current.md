### AGENDA
1. Topic: Linking resource metadata to NFTs
    1. Using the example of Certified Emission Reductions for the Quality Carbon Credits user story, we will work through the process from generating claims to issuing non-fungible tokens, with linked resources and assertions.
This will enable us to test the Interchain NFT+Metadata architecture model.
We will focus on how the W3C Verifiable Credentials specification can be used to describe and make assertions about tokenised resources.
2. Github Issues and PRs
